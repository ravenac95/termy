termy - Simple CLI Builder Inspired by flask-script
===================================================

Goals:

- Provide a simple way to create command line interfaces
- Provide simple command routing (think flask but for CLI's)
- Provide a simple way to handle configuration
- Be easily embeddable and provide tools to update when embedded. This way no
  one has to actually have termy as a dependency which can be very convenient.
